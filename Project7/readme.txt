   Overview 450 compiler project
========================================================================
1. cd into directory project 7 and run parser.bat with an argument i.e. parser.bat ex1.md
2. Sorry they are all in the same directory I was just having issues even though I had defined my directories correctly in VS so they are all in one directory.

What I did?
When I left we had defined the grammar (underline, bold, italics) so I went and made tokens for and added h1. 
I ,of course, changeg markdown scanner to handle all the grammar
I also tried to change the markdown to handle wiki notations of the same type. 
I had several issues with the scanner not compiling so I changed that and and the utf8sequences so VS could handle it.
I updated changed and updated the parser along with that
